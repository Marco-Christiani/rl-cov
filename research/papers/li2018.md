Li, Jinke, Ruonan Rao, and Jun Shi. “Learning to Trade with Deep Actor Critic Methods,” n.d. https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCID.2018.10116.

**Action Space:** short, neutral, long for each asset

**Architecture and methodology:** Authors propose a custom Actor-Critic architecture I have not seen before. Actions are computed by “bagging” over the outputs of the value and policy networks.

Overall, I am not clear on why the authors did this and they do not provide explanation. Actor Critic algorithms exist, and they do not “bag” the outputs together like this, which seems questionable.
